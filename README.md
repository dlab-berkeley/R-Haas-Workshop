# D-Lab's R Haas Workshop

This repository contains the materials for D-Lab's R Workshop for Haas.

## Goals

This is a lightweight module aimed to provide a brief introduction to R. Topics include
- Introduction to R, navigating Jupyter Notebooks, variable assignment, data types and coercion, and data structures.
- Working with data frames in R.

No prior experience with R is required.

## Installation Instructions

We will use Jupyter on the Haas JupyterHub to go through the workshop materials.

### Using DataHub

We *strongly* recommend using the Haas Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button: 

[![DataHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://mba200a-fall-2022.haastech.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FR-Haas-Workshop&urlpath=tree%2FR-Haas-Workshop%2Flessons%2F01_introduction.ipynb&branch=main)

Some users may have to click the link twice if the materials do not load initially.

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in an instance on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is needed from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. 

### Optional: Local installation
If you want to downloading the workshop materials locally: 

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

If you're familiar with git, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone https://dlab-berkeley/R-Haas-Workshop.git`. 

### Run the Code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time.

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the Python-Fundamentals folder you downloaded above.

3. Open the lessons folder, then open 01_Introduction.ipynb to begin.

Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels, and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services.
