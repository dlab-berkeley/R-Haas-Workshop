    "Unlike many graphical systems, you don't need to press a button to run your code! Instead, **you typically run code using Shift-Enter**. This also moves you to the next box (or \"cell\") for code below the one you just ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Jupyter notebooks has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.\n",
    "- Tab complete allows you to easily access the names of things you are using and learn more about them.\n",
    "- It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text, bullets, etc., to make it more accessible to you and your collaborators.\n",
    "- It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them to tell a complete story of the analysis.\n",
    "- The notebook is stored as JSON but can be saved as a .py file if you would like to run it from the Bash shell or a Python interpreter."

    "\n",
    "A recurring theme in programming is **abstraction**. We use a placeholder to _represent_ some other value or operation to make our code, so that we don't have to keep typing out those values or operations repeatedly. Variables are an abstraction of values: for example, rather than always having to type out the value for pi, we can store it in a variable called `pi`, and simply reference that. In the same vein, **functions** are abstractions of sometimes complex actions.\n",

    "**Arguments** are the inputs - values, expressions, text, entire datasets, etc. You tell a function what arguments it needs inside the parentheses. Sometimes, these arguments are \"named\".
