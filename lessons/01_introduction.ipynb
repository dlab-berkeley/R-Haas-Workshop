    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",

No installation is needed from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time.\n",

    "Unlike many graphical systems, you don't need to press a button to run your code! Instead, **you typically run code using Shift-Enter**. This also moves you to the next box (or \"cell\") for code below the one you just ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Jupyter notebooks has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.\n",
    "- Tab complete allows you to easily access the names of things you are using and learn more about them.\n",
    "- It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text, bullets, etc., to make it more accessible to you and your collaborators.\n",
    "- It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them to tell a complete story of the analysis.\n",
    "- The notebook is stored as JSON but can be saved as a .py file if you would like to run it from the Bash shell or a Python interpreter."
